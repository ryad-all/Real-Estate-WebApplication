## Technologies Explored
* **HTML** - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.

* **CSS** - CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling the visual presentation of web pages, enhancing the look and feel of HTML elements.

* **JavaScript** - JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for creating interactive and dynamic web content, enhancing user experience on websites.

* **BootStrap** - Bootstrap is a popular front-end framework that provides pre-designed templates and components to simplify and speed up the web development process.

* **Node.JS** - Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code server-side, enabling scalable and high-performance network applications.

* **LeafletJS** - Leaflet.js is an open-source JavaScript library used for interactive maps, making it easy to create mobile-friendly and interactive maps on web pages.

* **MongoDB** - MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system that provides a flexible, scalable, and high-performance solution for storing and retrieving data.

* **React** - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications, focusing on component-based development for efficient and interactive UIs.
  
*  **Ruby** -  Ruby. offers plenty of out-of-the-box features for web development, gives developers the freedom to apply creative solutions, just like Python, it's open source.

* **PHP**  - PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development. Ideal for small websites. It comes with a number of useful features including the MVC support, object-oriented libraries.

**Why we chose them:**

* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: These are fundamental web technologies and are essential for web development. They are chosen for their universality and compatibility with all web browsers, ensuring broad reach and accessibility.

* **Bootstrap**: Bootstrap is chosen for its extensive collection of pre-designed components and responsive grid system, enabling rapid prototyping and consistent designs across various devices, saving development time.

* **Node.js**: Node.js is preferred for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, allowing for highly scalable and efficient server-side applications. It's particularly suitable for real-time applications and microservices architectures.

* **Leaflet.js**: Leaflet.js is chosen for its simplicity, lightweight footprint, and ease of use in creating interactive maps. It offers a user-friendly API and supports various mapping providers, making it a popular choice for web mapping applications.

* **MongoDB**: MongoDB is selected for its flexibility in handling unstructured data, horizontal scalability, and ease of integration with modern web applications. It's suitable for projects where rapid development and scalability are crucial.

* **React**: React is chosen for its component-based architecture, virtual DOM rendering for optimal performance, and a vibrant ecosystem. It provides a seamless way to build complex UIs, making it a preferred choice for interactive and dynamic web applications.

**Why we did not use them:**

* **Ruby**: Ruby as confusing or difficult to learn synthax and the community of Ruby developers is not as large as the community for some other programming languages making it harder to debug.

* **PHP**: PHP, as limited debugging tools and as major security issues.
